# CS247 Final Project

## Project Introduction
This project builds on the **emg2qwerty** project by Joe Lin, which can be found here: [emg2qwerty GitHub Repository](https://github.com/joe-lin-tech/emg2qwerty). 

The goal of this project is to tune different recurrent neural network models to predict typed keystrokes given a sequence of sEMG signals.
